Blimey, I tell you, I am bored lately. I had hoped Underrail would provide a good distraction for a couple weeks, and it was looking good for a minute, but boy howdy did that game fall apart for me quickly. Gonna maybe see if I can faff around with the X series, and finally learn THAT; maybe pick up X4 on the summer sale.

Other than that, this Invincible show seems like it might be cool. Stultifyingly violent, though; and I've been around.
